#Advanced Library Managment System

##Description:
This system is intended to manage a library system, including user id's, a book catalogue, and a database of author's with some basic information about them. The program is made up of 3 modules, author_systems, user_systems, and book_systems, as well as a main function to run all the modules.
The author_systems module allows the user to enter a new author into the database, as well as view the author details, and list all authors currently in the database. The user_systems module allows the user to enter a new user, get details of the user based off the user id, including a list of
books the user currently has checked out from the library, and list all user ids currently in the database. The book_systems module can add books to the library catalogue, check them out to a sppecific user, return them, list all books in the catalogue and get details on a specific book.
